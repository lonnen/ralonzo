ralonzo
=======

A lisp interpreter written in Rust and based on [Scheme](http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/) with a practical nod towards [Clojure](https://clojure.org/). Similar to [Alonzo](https://github.com/lonnen/alonzo/blob/master/README.md), this is intended as a learning excercise.
